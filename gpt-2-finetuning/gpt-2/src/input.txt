“Maximalism” is having a moment. But what does it really mean? In fashion and design circles, it is thrown around almost as frequently and hollowly as all variations of “curator”, the curator Jenelle Porter joked at the press preview for Less is a Bore: Maximalist Art and Design, her show at the Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA) Boston (until 22 September).
The exhibition’s starting point rewards knowledge of a battle of 20th century architectural maxims that began with Mies van der Rohe adopting “Less is More” as his mantra in 1947 to describe a rigidly pared-down Minimalist vision. In 1963, Robert Venturi then wittily retorted, “Less is a bore”, praising fluid design that takes on qualities and needs of its locale rather than blindly obeying the inflexible principles of an intellectual movement.
Stepping into the first of four galleries devoted to the show and pausing in front of a large-scale Sol LeWitt line drawing from 1976, faithfully reproduced and installed by the ICA staff using the artist’s set of directions, I anticipated a summer fling bent on attracting crowds of Boston Seaport visitors who wanted busy, decorative backdrops for their live Instagram stories.
My basement had recently been overrun with black mold, forcing me to unsentimentally purge 25% of all my belongings. Like plenty of other Americans, I was enjoying a Marie Kondo moment: I linked clarity of thought to Spartan interiors and Minimalist forms of artistic expression, perhaps as a way of filtering the bombardment of visuals on social media constantly calling on me to acquire and do more. I left the show convinced that it was time to wallpaper even my ceilings.
In addition to offering a rich visual primer on the Pattern & Decoration artists of the 1970s and 80s, Porter consciously included work by female artists who may be largely unknown to a general audience but deserve to be known, including Miriam Schapiro, Nancy Graves and Howardena Pindell. In the case of the latter, a Color Field painter who belatedly received her first museum survey last year, the work Artemis (1986) is a seemingly blithesome abstract play on the grid and the dot that pays homage to the circle. It is a shape that haunts Pindell’s practice, with connections to a childhood memory of visiting the South and observing at a restaurant that her glass was purposefully marred with a red dot to keep it separate for non-white diners.
Overall, the show, with its massive saffron and tangerine florals by Robert Zakanitch, an immersive, sugary parlour with playful rococo influences by Virgil Marti and a Kehinde Wiley portrait from the artist’s Haiti series, turned out to be primed for Instagram stories and, more importantly, vitally relevant. Porter treats the museum space as a giant canvas for triggering conversations about cultural appropriation, gender identity and the body, and inclusivity, as well as who is granted or denied access to institutions and the art market, and why. Although the exhibition pleasantly blurs lines between craft, design and art through a devotion to pattern, there isn’t a piece in sight that is merely decorative, even the chairs.
The St Fagans National Museum of History in Cardiff has been awarded the UK’s Museum of the Year 2019 award. The £100,000 prize was presented to David Anderson, the director general of National Museums Wales, by the artist Jeremy Deller at a ceremony this evening at the Science Museum in London.St Fagans, on the outskirts of the Welsh capital, is the most visited heritage attraction in Wales and focuses on the country’s history and culture. The open-air museum is home to more than 40 historical buildings—from Iron Age roundhouses to a post-war prefab bungalow—that have been transported from across Wales and re-erected on its 100-acre site. Visitor can also see blacksmith’s and clog-makers show off traditional skills and experience crafts such as stone carving, pottery and woodworking.The organisation underwent a £30m, six-year redevelopment project that was completed in October 2018, helping it to become Wales’ National Museum of History and adding new galleries and learning spaces. It remained open to the public during the works.A blacksmith at work at St Fagans National Museum of
The Museum of the Year award is the largest art prize in the UK is given to a museum that “has shown exceptional imagination, innovation and achievement across the preceding 12 months”, according to a statement from the organisers.
The judging panel was chaired by the Art Fund director Stephen Deuchar who says: “[St Fagans is] a monument to modern museum democracy, it has been transformed through a major development project involving the direct participation of hundreds of thousands of visitors and volunteers, putting the arts of making and building into fresh contexts.”
The judges of this year’s award were the artist David Batchelor; the broadcaster Brenda Emmanus; the chief executive of Glasgow Life, Bridget McConnell; and the director of the Warburg Institute, Bill Sherman.
The four other finalist were HMS Caroline in Belfast, Nottingham Contemporary, Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford, and V&A Dundee. Each losing finalist received £10,000.
The Louvre in Paris has removed the name of the Sackler family from its walls, becoming the first major museum to erase its public association with the philanthropist family linked with the opioid crisis in the United States.
The Louvre’s collection of Persian and Levantine artifacts is housed in a wing that has been known as the Sackler Wing of Oriental Antiquities since 1997. But on Wednesday, a plaque acknowledging the Sacklers’ donations had been removed from the gallery’s entrance, and references to “the Sackler Wing” on other signs in the museum had been covered with gray tape. Members of the Sackler family own Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin, an enormously profitable and frequently abused painkiller that is the subject of numerous lawsuits in the United States. In March, Britain’s National Portrait Gallery turned down a $1.3 million donation from a charitable arm of the family. That prompted a host of cultural institutions across Europe and the United States, including the Tate group of museums in Britain and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York, to announce that they would not accept further donations from the family. The Sackler Trust and the Dr. Mortimer and Theresa Sackler Foundation, two foundations based in Britain, suspended further philanthropy. But many museums also said they would respect past philanthropy and would not be changing the name of any wing or gallery named after the family. Sophie Aguirre, 50, a guard at the Louvre, said on Wednesday that the plaque at the wing was taken down on either July 8 or 9, when the wing was closed to visitors. Nine other signs in the building that referenced the wing had been taped over. Ms. Aguirre said another large sign that acknowledged the Sackler donation had also been removed.References to “the Sackler Wing” have also been removed from the Louvre’s website. On Tuesday, Jean-Luc Martinez, the museum’s president, told RTL, a French radio station, that the Sackler name had been taken down because the Louvre’s policy on naming rights is that they last for 20 years. A spokeswoman for the Louvre did not respond to emails asking why, if naming rights only lasted 20 years, the name had not been painted over earlier. The Sackler family declined to comment through a spokesman from Edelman, the public relations firm that represents them in Britain. The Louvre’s action comes after the photographer Nan Goldin, a former opioid addict, led a protest outside the museum’s famous glass pyramid by the activist group PAIN. At a small demonstration on July 1, activists unfurled a banner reading “Take down the Sackler name.”“I think it happened due to our protests,” Ms. Goldin said on Wednesday in a telephone interview.
“It shows direct action works,” she said, and urged other museums to follow the Louvre’s lead.
“This is the next step,” she added.
Many museums are contractually obliged to continue using the Sackler name. In June, the Smithsonian Institution said it would not remove the Sackler name from its Asian art museum, and that it was legally required to keep it in perpetuity, The Washington Post reported. Arthur M. Sackler, who died before OxyContin was created, donated 1,000 objects and $4 million toward the construction of the museum.
In May, the Metropolitan Museum of Art said it would stop accepting gifts from the family, but had no plans to rename its Sackler Wing. Ms. Goldin said she recognized that many museums could not follow the Louvre’s example without breaking their contracts, but she hoped they found a way. “I know that the museums, especially in America, have enormous trouble being funded and it’s so important museums stay open,” she said. “But museums are also about ethics and morality.” A spokeswoman for the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, which has a Sackler Courtyard, said in an emailed statement on Wednesday that the museum was “not considering the removal of any signage related to our past or present donors.”
“We’re proud to have been supported by the Sacklers,” Tristram Hunt, the museum’s director, told the BBC on July 10.
Tate did not intend to rename the Sackler escalator at Tate Modern, it said in an emailed statement on Wednesday. A spokeswoman for the Jewish Museum in Berlin said in a telephone interview on Wednesday that the Louvre’s move did not change an earlier statement about its Sackler staircase.
“We will not be changing the name because we feel that renaming would be an inappropriate attempt to disguise what happened,” that statement, issued in March, said. “It would also contradict the fact that we acted in good faith.”

Manchester Jewish Museum closes for £5m redevelopment
Surrounded by a brutalist modern-day industrial estate, an extraordinary piece of 19th-century architecture peeps out from behind an overgrown hedge.
The Grade II*-listed building described by English Heritage as “one of the highlights of Victorian Gothic architecture in the country” is the oldest surviving synagogue in Manchester. However, this red-brick mismatch with its surroundings is somewhat unloved, after being deserted by its congregation in the 1980s. The Victorian building, Moorish in style and built by Jewish cotton traders from Spain and Portugal, sits in what was once a thriving Jewish quarter. Its congregation were Sephardi Jews, originally from the Iberian peninsula. The synagogue was deserted by its congregation in the 1980s. Others nearby were demolished or converted. In 1911 more than 30,000 Jewish people lived and worked in Cheetham Hill, one of Manchester’s most culturally diverse suburbs, which has also been home to Irish, Caribbean and Asian immigrants. But the community left for the leafier suburbs to the north and south of the city and the area’s synagogues were abandoned, demolished or converted. Now sitting among takeaways and textile warehouses, and just a few streets away from Strangeways prison, this synagogue’s survival is exceptional.
Given a new lease of life as the Manchester Jewish Museum in 1984 – Britain’s only Jewish museum outside London – it became home to more than 30,000 objects, from personal letters and photographs to Torah scrolls hidden from the Nazis during WWII. These objects tell the story of Jewish Manchester as well as broader stories of migration, identity and the Holocaust. But all agree that it is due a facelift. It was last refurbished more than three decades ago and its size means curators have only ever been able to showcase about 1% of the collection.

In just a few days the museum will close its doors for almost two years for an ambitious £5m development project, partly funded by a National Lottery grant of £2.89m in 2017. There will be a new cafe serving hot salt beef bagels, chicken soup with matzo balls and potato latkes. The museum itself will double in size, with new galleries, learning spaces and a shop built in an extension connected to the existing building by a glass bridge. But for its chief executive, Max Dunbar, who has worked at the National Portrait Gallery, Christie’s auctioneers and the World Rugby Museum, the most exciting part of the project is the new “learning kitchen”.
In recent years the former synagogue has become an event space for the local community, hosting everything from Bollywood concerts to hip-hop nights and Polish dumpling tastings. Dunbar said: “We have always found that food brings people together, so the learning kitchen will be a community space where we will break bread together, have curry nights and allow people to interact in a way that they wouldn’t normally.
“We are very conscious that we need to support this community and reach out to them. This will not just be a space for the Jewish people here, it will be for everyone. We are planning to challenge the perception of what a Jewish museum is.”
The redeveloped museum is hoping annual visitor numbers will rise from 10,000 to 40,000 when it opens in 2021.
As the museum packs up to move to its temporary home in Manchester Central Library, its creative producer, Laura Seddon, says she has made some “exciting discoveries” – this being the first time in years all of the museum’s collections have been opened and catalogued.
Seddon discovers a second world war letter from a Jewish family, the Leisers, thanking the Singleton family in Moss Side for the care of the Leisers’ children Fanny and Manfred, who had come from Germany on the kindertransport. Fanny and Manfred travelled to the US in 1947 aged 16 and 13 and were reunited with their mother.
The letter ends: “I thank you a thousand times for what you have done for my children and me.”
Dunbar hopes that stories such as this will help bring communities together in what he described as “troubled times”.
“The stories we are uncovering of Manchester’s Jewish community are also the stories of today. We learn about Jewish people who were forced to flee their homes and settled in alien environments trying somehow to rebuild their shattered lives.
“These stories remind us what happens when politics and religion seek to drive us apart and how a wonderful, diverse city like Manchester can bring people together.”
Europe’s museums serve a nuanced purpose and shouldn’t automatically bow to calls to return artworks plundered by 19th-century colonisers, writes V&A director Tristram Hunt
“I am from a generation of the French people for whom the crimes of European colonialism are undeniable and make up part of our history,” announced Emmanuel Macron to a crowded lecture theatre at Ouagadougou University, in Burkina Faso, in November 2017. “I cannot accept that a large part of cultural heritage from several African countries is in France … In the next five years, I want the conditions to be created for the temporary or permanent restitution of African patrimony to Africa.” In case anyone missed the significance of the French president’s remarks, the Elysée Palace was swift to spell out the new policy: “African heritage can no longer be the prisoner of European museums.”
The following year brought another notable intervention, this time from supervillain Erik Killmonger in the Marvel blockbuster Black Panther. Surveying the African collection at the “Museum of Great Britain”, Killmonger corrects the exhibition’s patronising white curator about the provenance of an axe: “It was taken by British soldiers in Benin, but it’s from Wakanda. Don’t trip – I’m gonna take it off your hands for you.” When the woman replies that the items are not for sale, Killmonger says: “How do you think your ancestors got these? Do you think they paid a fair price? Or did they take it, like they took everything else?” As the poisoned curator collapses, Killmonger deaccessions the artefact. Black Panther took just 26 days to reach $1bn (£784,000) in worldwide box office sales and, in one compelling scene, highlighted all the current controversies over museum collections and colonial injustice.
Macron’s pledge and Killmonger’s heist had context. The preceding decade had brought growing demands for the restitution of artefacts taken from Africa by European colonists during the 19th century. If the case for the restitution of human remains to indigenous communities had been, by and large, acceded, the new frontier was works of art. The UN kickstarted the conversation in 2007 with article 11 of its declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples, which urged states to restore “cultural, intellectual, religious and spiritual property” taken from indigenous people without their “free, prior and informed consent or in violation of their laws, traditions and customs”. With that aim in mind, the Benin Dialogue Group was established the same year as part of an effort to get European museum curators talking to key representatives in Nigeria.

Action soon followed. In 2009, Egypt demanded that the Louvre return five fragments of a wall painting from the tomb of Tetaki, an 18th-dynasty noble. In 2012, Nigeria requested the return of 32 objects from the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston that had been looted by the British army during a raid on the Royal Palaces of Abomey in 1897. In 2017, a year after the president of Benin had made an official request to the French foreign ministry for the return of items taken during imperial occupation, Nigeria made a further request, asking the British Museum in London to return the celebrated Benin bronzes.
A core objective of the Benin Dialogue Group was the creation of a permanent display in Benin City of objects once belonging to the former kingdom and now in continental hands. Last year, Hermann Parzinger, president of the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation, called for international guidelines akin to the Washington principles (which address the restitution of Nazi-confiscated art to descendants of dispossessed, predominantly Jewish families) to help museums handle provenance research and repatriation of illegally acquired artworks in public collections. It is no coincidence that much of this thinking coincided with growing calls for western European nations to apologise for various “crimes” of empire, from the Germans in Namibia and the Dutch in Indonesia to the British in Kenya and India and the French in north Africa.
However, it was Macron’s intervention that signalled a step change. “This is a revolution,” declared French art historian Bénédicte Savoy. “In two minutes and 33 seconds… Macron swept aside several decades of official French museum policy.” Savoy was appointed, alongside the Senegalese economist and writer Felwine Sarr, to write a report on implementing the Macron vision. The resulting study, published last November, recommended the restitution of “any objects taken by force or presumed to be acquired through inequitable conditions” by the army, scientific explorers or administrators during the French colonial period in Africa, which lasted from the late 19th century until 1960.
In the report’s aftermath, museums across Europe raced to develop new policies on restitution and repatriation – not least at the Victoria and Albert Museum. Having previously worked as an MP, I am used to politics. But since my appointment as director of the V&A in February 2017, I have been taken aback by the intensity of the repatriation debate. As a museum born of the imperial moment, the question of provenance and ownership in a post-colonial age is particularly germane. The V&A’s collections expanded in line with the growth of the British empire, in its official and unofficial guise, across southern Asia, showcasing Indian textiles, Burmese lacquerware, Chinese porcelain, and Persian carpets – as well as a remarkable range of British industrial designs and European Renaissance treasures. In Britain’s colonies and spheres of influence, the practice of collecting was intimately tied to the dominating psychology of colonialism. From the beginning of my directorship, I wanted to be open and transparent about that colonial past, and think carefully about how to manage its legacy today. So too did colleagues on the continent.
“It’s a disgrace that the Netherlands is only now turning its attention to the return of the colonial heritage,” Taco Dibbits, the Rijksmuseum’s director, told the Dutch newspaper Trouw as he opened talks on the restitution of colonial-era loot to Indonesia and Sri Lanka. “We should have done it earlier and there is no excuse.” Similarly, the Netherlands’ National Museum of World Cultures pledged proactively to return all artefacts within its collection identified as stolen during the colonial era – starting with 139 Benin bronzes, eligible for repatriation to Nigeria. Just outside Brussels, in Tervuren, the Royal Museum for Central Africa turned itself from an institution that celebrated the colonial history of Belgium in the Congo to one that consciously confronted the multiple crimes of King Leopold’s African empire. As parks in eastern Europe are dotted with the fallen statues of Stalin and Lenin, so the Brussels museum pulled down its highly racialised and offensive African statuary (placing them on show as a relic of European colonial thought). And in Berlin, Germany’s 16 state cultural ministries, the foreign office, and urban municipalities agreed to work with museums on a set of guidelines for the return of objects taken from former colonies. “All people should have the opportunity to meet their rich material cultural heritage in their countries and communities of origin, to interact with it and pass it on to future generations,” they concluded.
At the same time, an exciting wave of new museums was announced across Africa. The Museum of Black Civilisations in Dakar, Senegal, was opened in 2018, with capacity for about 18,000 objects, alongside a clear demand for some of that space to be filled by items currently housed in European museums. New projects are also scheduled for the Javett Art Centre at the University of Pretoria, the Museum of National History in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the JK Randle Centre for Yoruba Culture and History in Lagos. The opening of the Benin Royal Museum in Benin City is scheduled for 2021.
The Macron intervention and Savoy/Sarr report represent a philosophical disavowal of the bullish defence of western, encyclopaedic museums articulated in the 2002 “declaration on the importance and value of universal museums”, signed by 18 prominent institutions including the Louvre and New York’s Metropolitan Museum. When it came to the troubled provenance of parts of their collection, the declaration decreed that “over time, objects so acquired – whether by purchase, gift or portage – have become part of the museums that have cared for them, and by extension part of the heritage of the nations which house them”. James Cuno, president of the J Paul Getty Trust, fleshed out the argument for world collections in his book Museums Matter, writing: “Without [encyclopaedic museums], one risks a hardening of views about one’s own, particular culture as being pure, essential, and organic, something into which one is born… The collective, political risk of not having encyclopaedic museums… is that culture becomes fixed national culture.” Cuno thought it highly reductive to condemn a collection solely because of an imperial connection, adducing Edward Said’s argument that “partly because of empire, all cultures are involved in one another; none is single and pure, all are hybrid, heterogenous, extraordinarily differentiated, and unmonolithic.”
This nuanced account of the impact of empire represents an increasingly singular stance amid the increasingly vocal public and professional campaign to “decolonise the museum”. In a 2016 TedX talk on the latter theme, Cinnamon Catlin-Legutko, president and CEO of the Abbe Museum in Maine, urged fellow museum professionals to give voice and power back to formerly colonised people in an effort to make colonial histories more present in western museums. Olga Viso, the director of Minnesota’s Walker Art Center, concurred. “If museums want to continue to have a place, they must stop seeing activists as antagonists,” she wrote. “They must position themselves as learning communities, not impenetrable centres of self-validating authority. If they do not, museums run the risk of becoming culturally irrelevant artefacts.”
The debate was further energised in April 2018, when Brooklyn Museum hired a white scholar as consulting curator of African art. An open letter from Decolonize This Place, a New York-based action group intent on an overhaul of the city’s museums, described the decision as “tone deaf”, calling on the museum to “participate in the creation of a Decolonization Commission… to account for their own role in the histories of colonialism and white supremacy”. The group called for this commission to be tasked with diversifying the museum’s staff and reviewing its inventory of colonial-era artefacts “with a view to settling the long-pursued claims of reparations and repatriation”.
Curiously, yet tellingly, Decolonize This Place also sought an end to “pro-Israeli artwashing” and “an institutional commitment to address the issues raised by the boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement” against Israel. What the establishment of the state of Israel had to do with the hiring of a white female curator in Brooklyn was unclear, but it exposed both the broader ideological (and racial) agenda of the movement and how the ‘decolonisation’ agenda can encompass so many differing strands.
There have been debates around the imperial past and its legacies in Britain, one example being the Rhodes Must Fall campaign, which called for the removal of a statue of Cecil Rhodes from an Oxford college. But while the call to decolonise museums is at an earlier stage than in the US, it is gathering pace. Birkbeck, University of London historian Emma Lundin has written of how “Rhodes must go, along with objects brought to Britain by colonial-era travellers” and urges the return of “purchased objects… acquired because of power imbalances between buyers and sellers”. Alice Procter, a University of London student, runs “uncomfortable art tours” of British museums focusing on questions of disputed provenance. She dismisses “the whole concept of the Museum… [as] a colonialist, imperialist fantasy, born from the fallacy that somehow the whole world can be neatly catalogued, contained in a single building, mapped out for easy digestion”. Clearly to her, the museum as well as Rhodes must go.
In 2016, a group of museum and heritage professionals formed Museum Detox, a network for people of black, Asian, Arabic or dual heritage. Led by Sara Wajid, head of engagement at the Museum of London, they aim to build awareness about diversity in cultural organisations, help members achieve leadership positions, and “creatively use radical approaches to dismantle unjust infrastructures in our national cultural institutions”. While numerous museums have, over many decades, addressed uncomfortable colonial histories through their events, last year Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery went further. Its exhibition The Past Is Now: Birmingham and the British Empire, which was conceived as “an experiment in how the story of the British empire may be told permanently”, brought together six external co-curators of colour from outside the museum world. “For many people of colour, collections symbolise historic and ongoing trauma and theft,” explained Sumaya Kassim, one of the artists involved. “The craftsmanship, the display case, the beauty of the institution that collects and protects its imperial hoard: the way items are described, the way they are catalogued and what gets shown and what remains hidden; all work to deny, retreat and forget.”
Despite much outside praise, the exhibition also drew criticism for giving the impression that “the British empire was unfailingly dreadful and uniquely evil”. More interestingly, those involved in its curation worried whether the exhibition had merely endorsed the status quo. “I do not want to see decolonisation become part of Britain’s national narrative as a pretty curio with no substance,” wrote Kassim. The fear was that “decoloniality” was already on its way to becoming a buzzword devoid of agency, like “diversity”. The cultural critic Jason Farago similarly urged western, encyclopaedic museums to go beyond inclusion, diversity, and even “decolonisation”, to rethink completely their approach. “A 21st-century universal museum has to unsettle the very labels that the age of imperialism bequeathed to us: nations and races, east and west, art and craft. It’s not enough just to call for ‘decolonisation’… the whole fiction of cultural purity has to go, too. Any serious museum can only be a museum of our entangled past and resent.”
How should an institution like the V&A respond to this new cultural climate, and honour its responsibilities as a global museum? Last year, on the 150th anniversary of the British invasion of Abyssinia, we attempted to chart a pathway through with a small display highlighting our imperial, Ethiopian collections. At its heart sat the Maqdala crown, an exquisite work of African craftsmanship, commissioned by the Ethiopian Empress Mentewab in the 1740s, alloyed with silver and copper with filigree work and glass beads. But, as the display made clear, the crown came into the V&A’s possession in less pretty circumstances.
Its route to South Kensington originated with the mid-19th century Abyssinian ruler, Emperor Tewodros II, and his ambition to build a modern nation state in east Africa. As a great Christian emperor, Tewodros hoped to push back the power of the Egyptians and sought the assistance of Queen Victoria and the British state in his endeavours. When Lord Palmerston revealed he had no intention of supporting his ambitions (not least because it might entail alienating Egypt, a major supplier of cotton), Tewodros took hostage the British emissary and a handful of European nationals. In response, Sir Robert Napier gathered together an expeditionary force of 13,000 men, stormed the Maqdala fortress, secured the release of the hostages, and then started to pillage. Sometime during the battle, Tewodros killed himself.
Under the stewardship of accompanying curator Richard Holmes, the crown, chalice, and other regalia made their way back to the British Treasury, were auctioned for the army prize fund and then transferred to numerous national museums, including the V&A. Many British politicians heralded the Abyssinian expedition as a textbook imperial intervention. But William Gladstone, the prime minister, told the House of Commons that he “deeply lamented, for the sake of the country, and for the sake of all concerned, that these articles… were thought fit to be brought away by a British army”. He urged that they “be held only until they could be restored”.
During the 20th century, a number of items held by the British government were returned to Ethiopia. Artefacts owned by the British Museum, British Library, National Army Museum and V&A could not legally be part of that process of restitution, however. So in March 2008, Girma Wolde-Giorgis, the president of Ethiopia, sent a letter to Sir Mark Jones, the V&A’s director at the time, stating that Ethiopians had “long grieved at the loss of this part of their national heritage” and urging “the return of Ethiopia’s looted treasures” “to cement the good relations between our two countries”. Yet discussions over how to pursue such an accommodation soon petered out. In 2018 we were clear that even if the objects could not be returned tout court, we should nonetheless work on a display as well as being open and transparent about how the items entered the collection, engaging with the Ethiopian embassy and the broader diaspora community, and offering the items on a long-term loan. If not decolonising the museum, the display was cognisant of the colonial context of the collection and its meaning for African-heritage communities.
Adamant that the restitution case remained outstanding, the Ethiopian government said they could not accede to a long-term loan, as that would signal a legal acceptance of UK ownership. “Ethiopia’s demand has always been the restoration of those illegally looted treasures. Not to borrow them,” responded Ephrem Amare, the Ethiopian National Museum director. That position was reaffirmed in March 2019 when the Ethiopian culture minister, Dr Hirut Kassaw, visited the V&A display. For the Ethiopian government, the collection was not simply an array of interesting design artefacts, but essential to the country rediscovering its history and charting a new way forward. Kassaw’s trip to London included a successful visit to the National Army Museum, where she oversaw the return of two lockets of hair cut from the scalp of Tewodros in 1868 and now set to be reinterred with his remains.
Alongside the understandable official position, the Ethiopian ambassador Hailemichael Aberra Afework expressed satisfaction “with the new partnership between Ethiopia and the V&A”, expressing optimism about “future co-operation” on “the care and maintenance of cultural heritage, in which the V&A has extensive experience”. Productive conversations have since been held about a framework for co-operation – together with the British Library and British Museum - and we are working towards having the Maqdala treasures on show in Addis Ababa.
The V&A’s Maqdala experience highlighted the tensions facing national museums when it comes to restitution debates. Under the National Heritage Act 1983, the trustees of the V&A are specifically prevented from de-accessioning objects that are the property of the museum, unless they are exact replicas or damaged beyond repair. This remit was specifically enjoined to prevent the dispersal of “unfashionable” items from the collections (or, indeed, fundraising through the sale of valuable works), which later generations might have lamented.
But legislation is only part of the issue. I also feel we need to tread carefully along a path of total restitution, dictated by a political timetable. There remains something essentially valuable about the ability of museums to position objects beyond particular cultural or ethnic identities, curate them within a broader intellectual or aesthetic lineage, and situate them within a wider, richer framework of relationships while allowing free and open access, physically and digitally.
For a museum like the V&A, to decolonise is to decontextualise: the history of empire is embedded in its meaning and collections, and the question is how that is interpreted. A more nuanced understanding of empire is needed than the politically driven pathways of Good or Bad. For alongside colonial violence, empire was also a story of cosmopolitanism and hybridity: through trade, religion, war and force, peoples and cultures mixed and, in many cases, expressed that exchange and interaction through the type of material culture now found in museums. That was the case for the Roman, Ottoman, Ming, Ashanti, Habsburg and, yes, British empires. Today, power, wealth and art are being accumulated in the coming empires – informal and formal – of modern China and the Gulf states. Perhaps the real challenge is how we create more, rather than fewer, universal museums – not in Europe and the west, but across Africa, India and the global south. Our aim should be to detach the universal, encyclopaedic museum from its colonial preconditions and reimagine it as a new medium for multicultural understanding.
Calls for “decolonisation”, restitution and diversity look set to grow. Maqdala 1868 was a small step forward. So too our work on African heritage tours of the museum collections, research into the slave-owning wealth of early V&A benefactors, programming and exhibitions consciously focused on promoting diversity, sustained attempts to widen the talent pool of curatorial and conservation staff. About 47% of schoolchildren who visited the V&A in 2017-18 were from BAME backgrounds; clear progress has been made. However, the truth is that museum leaders must engage with this agenda and work on programmes of tangible change involving collections and curators, which can include the option of repatriation, in different forms, based on the history of each object. As Sabyasachi Mukherjee, director general of the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya in Mumbai, says: “Museums must recognise that unresolved repatriation and restitution disputes can, in the absence of serious efforts at conciliation, paralyse the sharing of significant cultural objects… institutional narratives or legal doctrines [must] not come in the way of celebrating a world culture.” If that is ignored, the momentum will pass into the hands of politicians – and in a two-minute-33-second speech, the complex, layered meaning of an object could be lost for ever to the reductive expediency of a passing agenda.

‘Let’s let them know we’re all here,” says Dan Vo, addressing a crowd of at least 100 in a space just off the domed entrance hall of London’s Victoria and Albert Museum. It’s the hottest day of the year so far, and the people fanning themselves with gallery maps have come to join the monthly LGBTQ tour, which Vo, a volunteer, helped set up four years ago. “On the count of three,” he bellows, “we’re just going to shout ‘queer’ – celebrating Stonewall, remembering how hard we fought to be here. One, two, three…” The word echoes off the barrel vaults of the sculpture hall and subsides as we head off in different directions – the tour is so popular that the group has to be split into at least six parties. Visitors are shown 10 or so objects throughout the museum, from a dress designed by Jean Cocteau to a sandstone sculpture of half-female, half-male deity Ardhanarishvara. The guides, who select the objects, are also volunteers, although the tours have been endorsed from on high: “Tristram [Hunt, the museum’s director] does write us very supportive letters,” Vo says. At the end, everyone goes for a drink.
The tour’s burgeoning popularity is part of a more general “queering” of British museums that is gathering pace. Institutions across the UK are teasing out stories of same-sex desire and gender nonconformity in artefacts that have, until now, been left untold, or actively suppressed. In 2015, National Museums Liverpool launched a research project to identify objects with an LGBTQ connection, resulting in a trail that takes in four separate venues. Last year, the University of Cambridge began piloting a tour programme that takes in its classical archaeology, zoology and polar museums (gay penguins make an appearance). Building on an audio trail devised in 2017 to mark the 50th anniversary of the partial decriminalisation of homosexuality, the British Museum recently announced it will offer volunteer-led tours around its permanent collection. And the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford has been awarded £91,200 in lottery funding to develop a series of exhibitions and permanent changes to its collection under the banner Beyond the Binary: Queering and Questioning Collections and Displays.
A darkly jumbled 19th-century anthropological museum, the Pitt Rivers is an unlikely setting for cutting-edge identity politics. But its openness to queer perspectives is part of a wider ethos of interrogation, borne out by the fact that even members of staff describe the collection, gathered magpie-like from cultures around the world, as “incredibly problematic”. Curators are preoccupied by questions such as: How did this stuff get here? Who is it for? And what stories are being told about it? “I think this is a moment of huge change in museums and particularly in collections like [ours],” says head of education Andy McLellan. “When people came into the museum 20 years ago, they just went, ‘Isn’t the Pitt Rivers museum a quaint place! And it’s got these lovely handwritten labels and, oh, they’re a little bit iffy but it’s all about the atmosphere.’ And people are coming into the museum today and they’re saying, ‘You need to change this. You need to face up to these issues. We want to find out about them – we don’t want you hiding them.’”
Part of the response includes finding new ways to interpret the objects already on display, sifting through the vast stores to find hidden gems, and even “ethically collecting” new artefacts: the museum is in discussions about acquiring designs by Corey Bulpitt, a First Nations artist from Canada, whose work based on the traditional Haida motif of the rainbow has been adopted by LGBTQ activists. During a short tour of Pitt Rivers’ spectacular cast-iron central court, research assistant Mara Gold picks out a cabinet containing knickers made from reindeer skin, brought back from a research trip to Siberia in 1915 by the Polish cultural anthropologist Maria Czaplicka. Her work focused on shamanistic societies and, according to Gold, she was the first scholar to differentiate between cross-dressing and being transgender, both of which she identified in different Siberian groups.
The Pitt Rivers is working closely with both “originating communities” and local LGBTQ people to overhaul its collection in a process that will take up to two years. Back at the V&A, the criteria for deciding what features in the tours are more straightforward. “We have a rule of three for choosing things,” says Vo. “Either the creator is queer, or it could be the object itself depicts a queer subject. The third and most important one is that it’s something the community may have taken on board as part of their story.” The plaster reproduction of Michelangelo’s David in the museum’s cast room satisfies all of these requirements, by virtue of the homoerotic friendship between biblical figures David and Jonathan, Michelangelo’s reputed homosexuality, and the fact that the statue was used as a discreet come-on by travellers returning from the grand tour. “If you brought back a statue of David and had it on your shelf, it was usually an invitation, a hint for others to approach you and say, I think there might be things we can talk about.”
Coded messages appear elsewhere in the museum, albeit in a different form. “I’m thinking of William Mulready and John Linnell,” Vo says, referring to 19th-century painters said to have been lovers. “It’s interesting that their paintings were placed side by side in the museum. Curators in the past left little signs like this for us to pick up.” And then there’s what Vo calls “historical gaydar”. “You can look at an object and think there’s something about this that I connect with. And more often than not it turns out that there is something [LGBTQ] there. There is definitely a quality that sort of vibrates across history to reach out and touch you.”
Harmless as they may seem – you don’t have to go on any of the tours, and the Pitt Rivers changes will affect only a fraction of its half-a-million items – efforts at queering haven’t always met with acclaim. The National Trust’s 2017 Prejudice and Pride programme, which aimed to show “how the often secretive lives of members of the LGBTQ community have helped shape the places we care for”, was labelled a “gay campaign” by the Telegraph and said to have provoked an (ultimately illusory) “membership crisis”. The Pitt Rivers is bracing for a similar reaction.
“There is going to be backlash, for sure, but I welcome it,” says Hannah Bruce, the Beyond the Binary activities officer. Does she worry that some visitors will be alienated by all the focus on LGBTQ issues? “You mean people suddenly experiencing a feeling where they’re like, ‘Oh, I’ve never been excluded in my life before’? It kind of has to happen,” she says. “Some people are used to being represented. And there are these other communities that have had zero representation.”
People from those communities seem to be pretty happy about finally seeing themselves in the picture. James Daykin, 44, travelled from Banbury to attend the Pitt Rivers tour. “I think it’s fantastic. It’s the start of something.” Daykin points out that the queering of museums doesn’t serve the needs of just LGBTQ people. It’s for everyone, to show that “We’ve always been a part of society. We’ve always been contributors to society. We didn’t just appear 50 years ago. And we didn’t just appear 50 years ago with the intention to wreak havoc on the world, you know?”
By the end of the tour at the V&A, a mother and daughter from Edinburgh named Zoe Agnew, 60, and Harriet Phillips, 21, are bubbling over with excitement. “When Harriet first came out to me, I wasn’t in a good place at that time, so I wasn’t very accepting of it.” But that has changed to the extent that, as Harriet points out, the V&A visit was entirely her mum’s idea. “I just want to educate myself,” Zoe says.
“Once you start seeing it, you see it everywhere. Sculptures, paintings … and you just go, how come I never noticed this before? It’s all there, but it’s all been stifled – it’s all been shut up. It’s so life-affirming. You know, she’s my daughter, I love her, I want her to be able to live in a world where people accept her for who she is.”
At this point, Harriet beaming beside her, Zoe grabs me for a spontaneous hug, wondering out loud: “I don’t know if you hug journalists!” I assure her it’s fine, before leaving them in the shop, buoyed up by their infectious enthusiasm. Whatever else it does, a queered museum can definitely put a spring in your step.
